## 1. What is zustand?
A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy API based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated.

Don't disregard it because it's cute. It has quite the claws, lots of time was spent dealing with common pitfalls, like the dreaded zombie child problem, react concurrency, and context loss between mixed renderers. It may be the one state-manager in the React space that gets all of these right.

### 2. What is the use of Zustand?
Zustand offers better performance than the context API by allowing components to subscribe only to the state they need. This selective subscription system ensures that components don't re-render unnecessarily, improving performance in situations where state changes frequently, such as input fields.

### 3. Is Zustand better than Redux?
In terms of performance, Zustand generally outperforms Redux and Context API due to its simplicity and lightweight nature. However, Redux can optimize performance using tools like Reselect or Redux Toolkit.
